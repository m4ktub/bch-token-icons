# Bitcoin Cash Token Icons

This project contains Bitcon Cash token icons in 4 sizes. Completely free. All we ask is that you donâ€™t claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in `32Ã—32`, `32Ã—32 (2x)`, and `128Ã—128` variants, along with SVG versions. Each token has a `name`, `symbol` and `tokenId` listed in [manifest.json](manifest.json).

There's also a [`generic` icon](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/bch-token-icons/blob/master/svg/icon/generic.svg) that can be used for cryptocurrencies missing an icon here.

If there is a token youâ€™re looking for that hasnâ€™t been included, please [create a new pull-request](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/bch-token-icons/pulls/new) and add it. Please include your icon in the 3 sizes mentioned above and add your token's `name`, `symbol` and `tokenId` to [manifest.json](manifest.json)

## Install ðŸš€

```
$ npm install bch-token-icons --save
```

You can then import the icons from `./node_modules/bch-token-icons`, for example `./node_modules/bch-token-icons/svg/icon/bch.svg`.

There's also a `manifest.json` file included in the package with a list of the currency symbol and name of the icons.
